Refactoring Homework

The original files had a lot of repititious code. I consolidated all div tags that shared the same specific formatting, provided alt tags for all of the images, and removed all class id's. I went back and forth between chrome inspector and vs code to take out any unneccessary code while still maintaining the original aesthetic.
